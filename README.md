# fortnite-player-analytics
This project investigates player behavior patterns in Fortnite using statistical analysis, linear algebra, and machine learning methods. The goal is not simply to predict performance metrics, but to uncover latent player structures, construct an interpretable skill index, and analyze how different behavioral profiles relate to competitive success.
